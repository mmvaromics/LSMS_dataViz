Data Visualization For Tabular Omics Data

This repository stores R scripts for the visualization of Tabular Omics Data. It was built to deal with filtered/normalized data from mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. Still, it could also be applied to other types of datasets, so long as the input format is maintained. Current options are highly editable boxplots, violin plots, and volcano plots using several packages such as tidyverse. The input files consist of two tab-delimited .txt files: Q_values_R.txt and V_list_R.txt.
