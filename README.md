Data Visualization For Tabular Omics Data

This repository stores R scripts for the visualization of Tabular Omics Data. It aims to deal with filtered/normalized data from mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. Still, it could also be applied to other types of datasets, so long as the input format is maintained. Please check the template data for examples of inputting your own data. Current options are highly editable boxplots, violin plots and volcano plots using the tidyverse package.
